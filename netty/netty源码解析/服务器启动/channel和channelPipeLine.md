# channel和channelPipeLine
## channel
### part1
```
A nexus to a network socket or a component which is capable of I/O
 * operations such as read, write, connect, and bind.
```
channel就是network socket的连接点,有读,写,连接,绑定的操作
```
* A channel provides a user:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the current state of the channel (e.g. is it open? is it connected?),</li>
   当前channel的状态
 * <li>the {@linkplain ChannelConfig configuration parameters} of the channel (e.g. receive buffer size),</li>
   参数
 * <li>the I/O operations that the channel supports (e.g. read, write, connect, and bind), and</li>
   支持的行为
 * <li>the {@link ChannelPipeline} which handles all I/O events and requests
 *     associated with the channel.</li>
```
我们看文档知道真正处理IO事件的是ChannelPipeLine.
### part2
```
 * <h3>All I/O operations are asynchronous.</h3>
 * <p>
 * All I/O operations in Netty are asynchronous.  It means any I/O calls will
 * return immediately with no guarantee that the requested I/O operation has
 * been completed at the end of the call.  Instead, you will be returned with
 * a {@link ChannelFuture} instance which will notify you when the requested I/O
 * operation has succeeded, failed, or canceled.
```
异步,因为是异步的,所以我们不能确定IO操作在什么时候完成,这个时候就需要ChannelFuture.
### part3
```
 * <h3>Channels are hierarchical</h3>
 * <p>
 * A {@link Channel} can have a {@linkplain #parent() parent} depending on
 * how it was created.  For instance, a {@link SocketChannel}, that was accepted
 * by {@link ServerSocketChannel}, will return the {@link ServerSocketChannel}
 * as its parent on {@link #parent()}.
 * <p>
 * The semantics of the hierarchical structure depends on the transport
 * implementation where the {@link Channel} belongs to.  For example, you could
 * write a new {@link Channel} implementation that creates the sub-channels that
 * share one socket connection, as <a href="http://beepcore.org/">BEEP</a> and
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">SSH</a> do.
```
channel是有层次的.
## channelPipeLine
### part1
```
 protected AbstractChannel(Channel parent, ChannelId id) {
        this.parent = parent;
        this.id = id;
        unsafe = newUnsafe();
        pipeline = newChannelPipeline();
    }
```
初始化位置
```
protected DefaultChannelPipeline(Channel channel) {
        this.channel = ObjectUtil.checkNotNull(channel, "channel");
        succeededFuture = new SucceededChannelFuture(channel, null);
        voidPromise =  new VoidChannelPromise(channel, true);

        tail = new TailContext(this);
        head = new HeadContext(this);

        head.next = tail;
        tail.prev = head;
    }
```
```
        tail = new TailContext(this);
        head = new HeadContext(this);
        final AbstractChannelHandlerContext head;
        final AbstractChannelHandlerContext tail; //上下文对象
```
```
final class TailContext extends AbstractChannelHandlerContext implements ChannelInboundHandler 
final class HeadContext extends AbstractChannelHandlerContext
                    implements ChannelOutboundHandler, ChannelInboundHandler
```
### part2
```
/**
 * A list of {@link ChannelHandler}s which handles or intercepts inbound events and outbound operations of a
 * {@link Channel}.  {@link ChannelPipeline} implements an advanced form of the
 * <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/interceptingfilter-142169.html">Intercepting Filter</a> pattern
 * to give a user full control over how an event is handled and how the {@link ChannelHandler}s in a pipeline
 * interact with each other.
```
ChannelPipeline表示一系列的ChannelHandler,操作和拦截进入和出去两种操作.
过滤器的模式.使得用户完全控制以及ChannelHandler互相作用 
```
 * <h3>Creation of a pipeline</h3>
 *
 * Each channel has its own pipeline and it is created automatically when a new channel is created.
```
创建的时机,就是在创建Channel的时候
### part3
```
* <h3>How an event flows in a pipeline</h3>
 *
 * The following diagram describes how I/O events are processed by {@link ChannelHandler}s in a {@link ChannelPipeline}
 * typically. An I/O event is handled by either a {@link ChannelInboundHandler} or a {@link ChannelOutboundHandler}
 * and be forwarded to its closest handler by calling the event propagation methods defined in
 * {@link ChannelHandlerContext}, such as {@link ChannelHandlerContext#fireChannelRead(Object)} and
 * {@link ChannelHandlerContext#write(Object)}.
 *
```
pipeline是如何操作的.
IO事件会执行入或者出,并且一直都是进入最近的那个handler,通过ChannelHandlerContext中的方法.
fireChannelRead和write.

 * </pre>
 * An inbound event is handled by the inbound handlers in the bottom-up direction as shown on the left side of the
 * diagram.  An inbound handler usually handles the inbound data generated by the I/O thread on the bottom of the
 * diagram.  The inbound data is often read from a remote peer via the actual input operation such as
 * {@link SocketChannel#read(ByteBuffer)}.  If an inbound event goes beyond the top inbound handler, it is discarded
 * silently, or logged if it needs your attention.
 * <p>
 * An outbound event is handled by the outbound handler in the top-down direction as shown on the right side of the
 * diagram.  An outbound handler usually generates or transforms the outbound traffic such as write requests.
 * If an outbound event goes beyond the bottom outbound handler, it is handled by an I/O thread associated with the
 * {@link Channel}. The I/O thread often performs the actual output operation such as
 * {@link SocketChannel#write(ByteBuffer)}.
```
一个是从下到上,一个是从上到下,互不干涉
```
 * <p>
 * For example, let us assume that we created the following pipeline:
 * <pre>
 * {@link ChannelPipeline} p = ...;
 * p.addLast("1", new InboundHandlerA());
 * p.addLast("2", new InboundHandlerB());
 * p.addLast("3", new OutboundHandlerA());
 * p.addLast("4", new OutboundHandlerB());
 * p.addLast("5", new InboundOutboundHandlerX());
 * </pre>
 * In the example above, the class whose name starts with {@code Inbound} means it is an inbound handler.
 * The class whose name starts with {@code Outbound} means it is a outbound handler.
 * <p>
 * In the given example configuration, the handler evaluation order is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 when an event goes inbound.
 * When an event goes outbound, the order is 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  On top of this principle, {@link ChannelPipeline} skips
 * the evaluation of certain handlers to shorten the stack depth:
 * <ul>
 * <li>3 and 4 don't implement {@link ChannelInboundHandler}, and therefore the actual evaluation order of an inbound
 *     event will be: 1, 2, and 5.</li>
 * <li>1 and 2 don't implement {@link ChannelOutboundHandler}, and therefore the actual evaluation order of a
 *     outbound event will be: 5, 4, and 3.</li>
 * <li>If 5 implements both {@link ChannelInboundHandler} and {@link ChannelOutboundHandler}, the evaluation order of
 *     an inbound and a outbound event could be 125 and 543 respectively.</li>
 * </ul>
```
### part4
事件传播是通过上下文来进行的.(从当前的过滤器走到另一个过滤器)
```
 * As you might noticed in the diagram shows, a handler has to invoke the event propagation methods in
 * {@link ChannelHandlerContext} to forward an event to its next handler.  Those methods include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Inbound event propagation methods:
 *     <ul>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#fireChannelRegistered()}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#fireChannelActive()}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#fireChannelRead(Object)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#fireChannelReadComplete()}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#fireExceptionCaught(Throwable)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#fireUserEventTriggered(Object)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#fireChannelWritabilityChanged()}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#fireChannelInactive()}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#fireChannelUnregistered()}</li>
 *     </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>Outbound event propagation methods:
 *     <ul>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#bind(SocketAddress, ChannelPromise)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#connect(SocketAddress, SocketAddress, ChannelPromise)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#write(Object, ChannelPromise)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#flush()}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#read()}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#disconnect(ChannelPromise)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#close(ChannelPromise)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link ChannelHandlerContext#deregister(ChannelPromise)}</li>
 *     </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
```
### part5
```
* {@link ChannelPipeline} pipeline = ch.pipeline();
 *
 * pipeline.addLast("decoder", new MyProtocolDecoder());
 * pipeline.addLast("encoder", new MyProtocolEncoder());//在IO线程中执行
 *
 * // Tell the pipeline to run MyBusinessLogicHandler's event handler methods
 * // in a different thread than an I/O thread so that the I/O thread is not blocked by
 * // a time-consuming task.
 * // If your business logic is fully asynchronous or finished very quickly, you don't
 * // need to specify a group.
 * pipeline.addLast(group, "handler", new MyBusinessLogicHandler());//单另出一个线程,执行,不会阻塞IO
```
